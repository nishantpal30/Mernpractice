        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Bhagat Singh is not just a name, but a symbol of courage, sacrifice, and revolution. Born in an era when India was shackled under British colonial rule, he chose the path of fearless resistance to liberate the nation. Even at a young age, he embraced martyrdom for a cause that transcended fear and selfishness: freedom for all.</p>
